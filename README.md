# üëã Welcome to Pylon Technology Solutions (PTSolns)

We are a Canadian üçÅ company developing high-quality electrical boards and modules, and related open-source software for the Maker community. Our products can be used in IoT Internet-of-Things projects, automation, prototyping, and Tinkering!

### Software Projects
[PTSolns IDE](https://github.com/PTSolns/PTSolns-IDE) - Our own IDE software that can be used to program a range of popular microcontroller development boards.

The following are libraries we've developed for particular boards, modules and common ICs:
- For *ESP32 microWatt*: [PTSolns_microWatt](https://github.com/PTSolns/PTSolns_microWatt)  
- For *I2C Backpack*: [PTSolns_I2CBackpack](https://github.com/PTSolns/PTSolns_I2CBackpack)  
- For *Interface-Shield*: [PTSolns_InterfaceShield](https://github.com/PTSolns/PTSolns_InterfaceShield)  
- For *Pico Base* family: [PTSolns_PicoBase](https://github.com/PTSolns/PTSolns_PicoBase)
- For any BMx280 (BMP280, BME280) sensor module: [BMx280](https://github.com/PTSolns/BMx280)

### PTSolns Documentation Repository
We take great pride in writing documentation for our products. Every products has detailed datasheets, 3D models high-quality images, and when applicable example code, schmatics, Fritzing models and more. All of these supporting materials are freely available to anyone and can be accessed on our [Documentation Repository](https://docs.ptsolns.com/).

### Tutorials, Blogs & Videos
We actively write tutorials, blogs and make videos. These resoures cover topics not just related to our products but many general topics in the Maker and electronics field. This includes IoT projects, technical analysis, engineering topics, 3D printing, tinker projects and much more. 


Our tutorials and blogs we publish on our [Tinker Thoughts Blog](https://ptsolns.com/blogs/tinker-thoughts) (TTB), but also guest post on DigiKey's [Maker.io](https://www.digikey.ca/en/maker), [RobotShop Community](https://community.robotshop.com/tutorials), and [Jameco Electronics Blog](https://www.jameco.com/Jameco/Blog/electronics-blog.html).


Our videos are published on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ptsolns).

### 3D Prints
Every once in a while we make a project that requires a custom 3D print such as an enclosure, a base, or something else. We publish all of these for anyone to download and print for themselves. Find them all on our [Thingiverse profile](https://www.thingiverse.com/PTSolns/designs).
