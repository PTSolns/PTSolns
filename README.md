# üëã Welcome to PTSolns

We are a Canadian üçÅ company developing high-quality electrical boards and modules, and related open-source software for the Maker community. Our products can be used in Internet-of-Things (IoT) projects, automation, prototyping, and Tinkering!

## Software Projects
[*PTSolns IDE*](https://ptsolns.com/ptsolns-ide) is free and open-source software for programming a wide range of microcontroller development boards. Our goals in developing and providing PTSolns IDE:

- Free to download, No subscriptions, No fees  
- No sign-ups, No sign-ins, No cloud  
- Open-source & Community driven  

*PTSolns IDE* comes with countless example sketches, is compatible with many common boards (AVR, RPi, Espressif, etc.) and over 8500 third-party custom libraries are available to be included. Other perks include CH340 driver inherent support and intuitive user-experience

## PTSolns Documentation Repository
We take great pride in writing documentation for our products. Every product has detailed datasheets, 3D models high-quality images, and when applicable example code, schmatics, Fritzing models and more. All of these supporting materials are freely available to anyone and can be accessed on our [Documentation Repository](https://docs.ptsolns.com/).

## Tutorials, Blogs & Videos
We actively write tutorials, blogs and make videos. These resoures cover topics not just related to our products but many general topics in the Maker and electronics field. This includes IoT projects, technical analysis, engineering topics, 3D printing, tinker projects and much more. 


Our tutorials and blogs we publish on our [Tinker Thoughts Blog](https://ptsolns.com/blogs/tinker-thoughts) (TTB). We also guest post on DigiKey's [Maker.io](https://www.digikey.ca/en/maker), [RobotShop Community](https://community.robotshop.com/tutorials), and [Jameco Electronics Blog](https://www.jameco.com/Jameco/Blog/electronics-blog.html).


Our videos are published on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ptsolns).

## 3D Prints
Every once in a while we make a project that requires a custom 3D print such as an enclosure, a base, or something else. We publish all of these for anyone to download and print for themselves. Find them all on our [Thingiverse profile](https://www.thingiverse.com/PTSolns/designs).
